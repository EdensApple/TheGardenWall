Read before you Interact:
- | Mentally neutral chaotic and silly, unless I vibe with you |
- | Dry to talk to unless I've talked to you before or I connect with your interests with mine's |
- | If I don't sit with you that means I don't know you personally ( no offense ) or I ( or you ) don't have a 'c+h' tag |
- | Usually AFK or Semi-AFK on PT due to watching YT, just whisper me ( compliments are okay too ) I have cos/skins that says I'm  AFK/Semi-AFK |
- | I love doing cos/skins similar with friend's particular interests, if that ain't you, then please don't ask about matching w/ me|
- | I particularly don't mind minors, I'm kinda childish, so what?  ( I have friends that are younger than me, mainly around 16-19 ) |
